#2.DO
___
A TODO app built upon HTML5 with cordova.

Finished all the work in one day and a half haha! Detailed instructions and documents will come tomorrow afternoon.

Also note that the app is still under development. This time released was a minimum viable product, still with some bugs to cover.

The project was originally intended for applying for the internship of Teambition. Since I do need a cross-platform TODO app and also not sure if I will be admitted to Teambition... I might keep working on it for at least a month. Hope the app will be much robuster but as simplified at that time!
