#2.DO
___
A TODO app built upon HTML5 with cordova.

Finished all the work in one day and a half haha! Detailed instructions and documents will come later.

Also note that the app is still under development. This time released was a minimum viable product, still with some bugs to cover.

The project was originally intended for applying for the internship of Teambition. Since I do need a cross-platform TODO app and am also not sure if I will be admitted to Teambition(QAQ)... I might keep working on it for at least a month. Hope the app will be much robuster but as simplified at that time!

###Update plan for May.24(Fri)
1. Add a feature that you can attach a photo with a TODO.
2. Add swipe gesture to switch among tabs.
3. Optimize UI details and fix bugs.

The TODO timer and TODO color tag will come early in June. Since I'm really busy these days.  

###Here are some screenshots.
